# bind-books
scripts to manage metadata and file structure for private document archive.

TODO:
	- Script initializes based on local file(s). f.ex. python bind-books.py title-of-pdf.pdf
	- generate XML to spec. Based on questions posed to the user. Author, year etc.
	- create folder structure, including a src folder to contain original file(s).
	- Hook new title into some database (tbd) to make the whole shebang searchable.
